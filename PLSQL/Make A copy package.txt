/*********************************************  COPY package ***************************

If the new package name already exists in the schema, it will be overwritten without warning.

The old package is left untouched.

If there are any grants or synonyms needed, they are not copied across.

If the package has code that happens to include the package name within a longer identifier (e.g. NOT_MY_PACKAGE_NAME) this will fail as it will replace that text indiscriminately.

If the package spec or body is greater than 32K in size, this procedure will fail.

If the package spec or body is not found, this procedure raises ORA-31603. If the spec was found but body was not, the spec will be copied, and then it will raise the exception.
